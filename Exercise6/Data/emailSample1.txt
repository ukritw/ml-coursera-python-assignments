Sakura Science Club Mail Magazine　Vol. 34
Greetings to all members!  
As described in our sci-tech news article below, the kanji character that best describes the year 2018 was "sai," meaning disaster. Not only does this ring true for Japan, but for the whole world. Just as our writers were preparing the magazine, we heard the shocking news of the tsunami in Indonesia’s Sunda Strait which struck without any warning. The secretariat would like to express sincere consolatation to those who were affected by the tsunami.
